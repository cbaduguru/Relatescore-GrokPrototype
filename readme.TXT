RelateScore™ Prototype
Overview
RelateScore™ is a private, consent-based relationship clarity platform designed to transform personal connection patterns into neutral maturity insights. Unlike dating apps that focus on matching and surface impressions, RelateScore™ provides psychologically safe reflection, emotional communication analytics, and non-comparative relational scoring. There are no public rankings, no ex-reviews, no blame mechanics, and no exposure culture.
The platform uses a proprietary Relationship Growth Index (RGI) generated only when both past partners opt-in to participate. All inputs are processed through a strict privacy framework, AI moderation, and DRM protection to prevent screenshots, saving, forwarding, or reputation harm. This prototype simulates the core flow, including user onboarding, invitation system, Likert calibration, assessment, RGI calculation, and a dashboard with the RQ Wheel for visual insights.
This app is built with Streamlit for easy deployment and testing. It targets adults seeking clarity, closure, and communication awareness in a safe, non-judgmental environment. The revenue model (not implemented here) includes premium clarity reports, AI coaching, therapist referrals, and future integrations.
